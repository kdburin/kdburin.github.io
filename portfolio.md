## Data Visualization Practice 

Practice project focused on building an end-to-end EDA workflow. I analyzed the Iris dataset and another dataset to practice:
cleaning, summary statistics, visualization, and drawing conclusions from distributions and relationships.

**What I did**
- Cleaned and organized the data for analysis
- Computed summary statistics (mean, variance, etc.)
- Built visualizations (histograms/boxplots/other plots) to compare distributions
- Practiced basic statistical comparisons and interpretation
