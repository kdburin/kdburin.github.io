## What I do
Inspired by data, driven by results — I turn real-world business questions into actionable insights using statistics,
time series analysis, econometrics, and Python/SQL.

## Featured work
- **Portfolio projects (coming soon):** forecasting, experimentation, and ML case studies.

## Certifications
- **FreeCodeCamp — Data Analysis with Python**  
  → [View certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/kirill_burin/data-analysis-with-python-v7)

## What I’m building next
- Add 2–3 real projects with clean write-ups (problem → method → results → takeaway)
- Publish short “notes” posts when I learn something useful
