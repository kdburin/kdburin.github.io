## Hi, I’m Kirill Burin

I’m an undergraduate student at **UC Davis** studying **Statistical Data Science**, and I’m building a career in **data science / analytics**. I enjoy working on problems where data can clarify what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what to do next.

Before UC Davis, I transferred from **Diablo Valley College**, where I earned an **Associate degree in Economics**. That background helps me think in both numbers and incentives—how people and businesses behave, and how data can be used to measure and improve outcomes.

### What I’m focused on
- Building end-to-end projects (cleaning → analysis → modeling/forecasting → communication)
- Strengthening fundamentals in statistics, time series, and econometrics
- Shipping work that is clear, reproducible, and useful for decisions

### Tools I use
- **Python** , **SQL**, **R**
- **Statistics / Programming / Econometrics**
- **Excel / Google Sheets**

### What’s next
In the future, I plan to pursue an **M.S.** and continue working on projects that connect strong statistical thinking with real-world impact.

### Outside of data
Outside of school and projects, I like filming videos, playing basketball, skating, and hiking—especially near the ocean with a good view.
